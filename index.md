# Scope

A major open problem in scientific visualization is the visualization of 3D time-dependent data, either scalar data for volume rendering or more challenging vector or even tensor fields. Traditionally, this problem has been tackled by focusing on efficient methods in order to animate in realtime, or by simply visualizing the data per time slice. In recent years, some approaches have emerged that exploit a more unified view of spacetime, such as reference frame optimization and its impact on objectivity measures, extraction of time-dependent flow topology, modeling a set of observers with observer velocity fields, characterization of spacetime features, or spacetime meshing. We consider topics like spatio-temporal graph layout and data analysis or feature tracking in time-varying data as related and within the scope of the workshop as well. STiVâ€™22 is intended to work out the basic foundations of spacetime techniques in visualization as well as to provide a forum for the development of novel techniques in this direction.
